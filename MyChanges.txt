Changes from the mainline CPAN module:

  * added support for the new commands in Redis 1.2.x (sorted sets,
    etc).  all are new bulk commands (zadd, zrem, zscore, etc.)

  * removed all the encoding stuff (for now)

Fixes being considered:

  * adding a "use bytes" in AUTOLOAD to prevent issues with wide
    characters since the module uses print()

  * Fix return for NULL result vs. empty result as described here:
